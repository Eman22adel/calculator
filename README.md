# calculator
This project is designed to create a calculator using an AVR microcontroller, a keypad, and an LCD. 

## Project Description
The calculator is capable of performing all standard mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In addition, it also supports programmer operations, providing the ability to convert decimal numbers to hexadecimal and binary formats.

Here are the programmer operations that the calculator can perform:

1. **DEC TO HEX**: This operation converts a decimal number to its equivalent hexadecimal representation. The user inputs a decimal number using the keypad, and the calculator displays the hexadecimal equivalent on the LCD.

2. **DEC TO BIN**: This operation converts a decimal number to its equivalent binary representation. The user inputs a decimal number using the keypad, and the calculator displays the binary equivalent on the LCD.

These features make this calculator a versatile tool for both standard and programmer-specific calculations.
